Look at this project and the given starter codes as well as the summary from the Word document. Provide some ideas for me to think about how I can tackle this question. Perhaps you can explain to me exactly what the logic behind the game is. Maybe explain a little bit more in detail about what exactly is going to happen within the entire process of from the start of the simulation to the end. Then you can perhaps explain connect that and explain the starter code, giving me a walk-through of the starter code and what they do so that I can have a good picture of where I am at and what I have to think about next.
