Add the following features to your Wellness Scheduling Project:

Allow for restricting talks into specific blocks based on the Restrictions column in the CSV (0=anywhere, 1=only 1, 2=only 2)
Add an email field to your Participant class that can be read under the "Email Address" header. Do this by altering the __init__ method.
Create two output documents (both of which should use the long name for session titles.
one that summarizes the sessions, what block they are in, where they are being held, and how many people have been assigned to them.
one that is a participant assignment CSV with the following columns: Name, Email Address, Block 1 Assignment, Block 2 Assignment
If you have additional time before the end of the block, make your project better:

Don't run two occurrences of a talk unless there are sufficient numbers to merit that.
Make sure every occurrence has at least 10 people assigned to it.
Make sure no talk is over the capacity of its room.
