## How long things take 

big-O notation: O(_)
worst case analysis, care about the end behavior as n -> infinity

1. Lists and how they work for CPython

[5,2,9,7,1,4]

.append()'s time complexity is O(1), because it's going to create a new list, 
replicate the original items in the old list, and append the new one, and plus O(1) (constant time) 

.pop() will be O(n)

.remove() is O(n) because it has to look for it and find it; worst case is at the last one. Then you'd have to shift it



Bubble Sort: O(n^2)
Selection O(n^2)
Insertion O(n^2)
mergesort: O(nln(n))
quicksort O(nln(n))
